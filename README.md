# 2D Night Sky Simulator
On February 14, 1990, as Voyager-1 left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the solar system, engineers turned it around for one last look at home. Caught in the center of scattered light rays (a result of taking the picture so close to the Sun), Earth appeared as a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Carl Sagan said this about that image- "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us." 
As inpsiring and humbling as that quote was (and is) it made me wonder how other planetary life (if it ever existed or exists) would view the night sky. 
Therefore, I built this simple, basic simulation of the night sky using particles.js.
